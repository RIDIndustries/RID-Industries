        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3px" color="#0000FF">This is all about me, I am a person who has always thought about career and never ever thought about intrests and now when i am starting to develop intresets I am able to do almost everything that I have had an intrest in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3px" color="#0000FF"> What I want to say is that focus on career bit pay attention on your intrests too maybe someday thse interests will be your career.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3px" color="#0000FF"> One day when I will be someone the whole world knows, no one will acctually care about what I had did in my past life all the struggles all the ups and downs, Listen there is only one person who will be with you all your life and that is you. You can do anything you want to do if you want to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3px" color="#0000FF"> According to me all things a common man does, he can always do more and better than what he is doing. The thing is that he is distracted, Marrige, family issues among others. What I say that is all these things just distract you from your true motive in life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3px" color="#0000FF"> I am going to avoid all these distractions to fulfil my life's true motive. Once i achive that I will achive more and more and never stop.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3px" color="#0000FF"> God has given us one life but 2 choices (a) distraction (b) concentration. I prefer option b, At lest I will die whithout regrets that I could never ever achive what I wanted to do in my life.</font></p>
